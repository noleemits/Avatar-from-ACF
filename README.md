# Avatar-from-ACF
A lightweight WordPress plugin that replaces the default Gravatar/avatar output with a user-uploaded image stored in an ACF avatar image field. Supports both core get_avatar() and get_avatar_url() filters, and ensures compatibility with Elementorâ€™s Author Image widget (handles post and dynamic tag objects)
